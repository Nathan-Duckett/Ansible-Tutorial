# Stage Two

This stage is set to expand further on the ansible configuration.

The goal is to create a set of default applications to install into a new development machine build.

This includes:
- Git
- Java JDK 11
- Maven

The aim is for the machine to be able to be built up with these components - be able to pull a specific commit using git and
is able to run maven tests on the code to verify it is correct.
