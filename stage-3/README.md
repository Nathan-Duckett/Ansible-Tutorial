# Stage Three

This stage is aimed at setting up configurations between the machine further. On top of installing the apps, 
this will aim to now also include copying configuration files across between the machines to provide a unified experience.

These features include:
- Installing ZSH shell and oh-my-zsh configurations.
- Installing bash aliases into configuration.
- Installing git configuration files.
- Adding further development environments and applications.
